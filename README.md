# Smart Speed Limit Sign Board for Changing Weather Conditions

This project presents a conceptual framework for a dynamic speed limit signboard system that adjusts speed limits based on real-time weather conditions. It aims to reduce road accidents caused by adverse weather by providing real-time speed limit updates using IoT and machine learning techniques.

## Objectives

- Develop a smart system for dynamically updating speed limits based on weather conditions.
- Utilize IoT technology and Raspberry Pi to fetch real-time weather data and adjust speed limits accordingly.
- Apply machine learning techniques, such as K-Means clustering, to classify weather conditions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The system collects real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. **Processing**: The weather data is processed and classified into different conditions (e.g., rain, snow, fog) using machine learning algorithms.
3. **Display**: Raspberry Pi and matrix displays are used to dynamically show updated speed limits based on weather conditions.

## Future Work

Future implementation involves developing Python scripts to connect Raspberry Pi with weather APIs and matrix displays. The system will be tested in a real-world environment to validate its effectiveness.
